# Introduction

This assignment focuses on software reliability assessment using two complementary techniques: Reliability Growth Testing and Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). Reliability Growth Testing uses statistical models to analyze failure data over time, helping us understand how the system's reliability improves as defects are found and fixed. The RDC approach provides a visual, decision-oriented method for determining whether the system under test meets a target Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). Together, these techniques give a comprehensive view of a system's reliability from both a modeling and an acceptance-testing perspective.

For this assignment, we used C-SFRAT (Covariate Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool) for reliability growth testing in Part 1 and the RDC-11 Excel macro for the Reliability Demonstration Chart analysis in Part 2.

# Data Selection and Preparation

## Part 1 Dataset - J3.DAT

For Part 1 (Reliability Growth Testing), we selected **J3.DAT** from the `Failure_Data_Set/Failure_Count/` directory. This dataset contains failure-count data measured in weekly intervals, with 41 time intervals and a total of 351 recorded failures. We chose this dataset because it has a sufficient number of intervals and failures to produce meaningful model fits, and it exhibits a clear reliability growth trend - the failure counts start high (peaking at 28-29 failures per week in intervals 5-6) and gradually decrease toward 0-1 failures per week by the end (intervals 37-41).

### Data Conversion for C-SFRAT

The J3.DAT file provides data in two columns: Time Interval (T) and Number of Failures (FC). However, C-SFRAT requires a CSV file with five columns: T, FC, E, F, and C - where E represents execution effort, F represents failure identification effort, and C represents computer-based effort.

Since the original dataset does not include effort data, we set E = F = C = 1 for all intervals (constant effort per interval). This is a reasonable assumption given that each interval represents one week of testing under presumably consistent conditions.

The final processed CSV used as input to C-SFRAT:

```
T,FC,E,F,C

38,0,1,1,1
39,0,1,1,1
40,1,1,1,1
41,1,1,1,1
```

**Assumptions:**
- Each time interval corresponds to one week of testing.
- Effort variables (E, F, C) are not provided in the raw data and are assumed to be constant at 1 per interval.
- Only failure count data is used; severity and description fields are not considered.

## Part 2 Dataset - DATA2.DAT

For Part 2 (Reliability Demonstration Chart), we selected **DATA2.DAT** from the `Failure_Data_Set/Time_Between_Failures/` directory. This is a widely referenced dataset from Musa (1987) representing a real-time command and control application with approximately 21,700 assembly instructions. It contains 28 failures with cumulative CPU execution times reported in seconds.

We chose a different dataset for Part 2 because the RDC requires individual cumulative failure times rather than interval-based failure counts. DATA2.DAT provides exact failure timestamps, making it directly compatible with the RDC-11 Excel tool without any conversion. Additionally, the 28 data points are a manageable size for the RDC chart display.

The failure data entered into the RDC-11 tool:

| Failure # | Cumulative Time (seconds) |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1 | 342 |
| 2 | 571 |
| 3 | 968 |

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing

## Model Comparison and Top Two Models

We loaded the processed J3 CSV into C-SFRAT and ran all available hazard functions (IFR Salvia & Bollinger, IFR Generalized Salvia & Bollinger, S Distribution, Discrete Weibull Order 2, Discrete Weibull Order 3, Geometric, Negative Binomial Order 2, and Truncated Logistic) with all covariate combinations (None, E, F, C, E-F, E-C, F-C, E-F-C). This produced 49 model-covariate combinations in total.

The Model Comparison table below shows the results for all models, ranked by key metrics including Log-Likelihood, AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).

![Model Comparison Table - Rows 1 to 19](Screenshots/1_Model_Comparison_Table_Rows1-19.png)

![Model Comparison Table - Rows 17 to 35](Screenshots/2_Model_Comparison_Table_Rows17-35.png)

![Model Comparison Table - Rows 31 to 49](Screenshots/3_Model_Comparison_Table_Rows31-49.png)

To select the top two models, we compared models based on the following criteria:
- **Log-Likelihood**: Higher (closer to 0) is better, indicating the model fits the observed data more closely.
- **AIC**: Lower is better, balancing model fit against complexity.
- **BIC**: Lower is better, with a stronger penalty for additional parameters than AIC.

We excluded Row 1 (IFR SB with no covariates) as it clearly failed to converge, evidenced by its extremely large AIC of 25666 and SSE of 917668.

**Top Two Models Selected:**

| Rank | Model | Covariates | Log-Likelihood | AIC | BIC |
|------|-------|-----------|----------------|-----|-----|
| 1 | TL (Truncated Logistic) | E | -134.589 | 277.177 | 284.032 |
| 2 | IFRGSB (IFR Generalized Salvia & Bollinger) | None | -137.074 | 280.147 | 285.288 |

The **Truncated Logistic model with covariate E** achieved the best fit with the lowest AIC (277.177) and highest log-likelihood (-134.589). The **IFR Generalized Salvia & Bollinger model with no covariates** was the second-best, with an AIC of 280.147 and log-likelihood of -137.074. Both models demonstrated strong predictive performance with Critic (Mean) values of 1.000, indicating excellent goodness-of-fit.

## Range Analysis

Not all portions of the failure data are equally useful for reliability growth modeling. The range analysis involves determining which part of the dataset is most suitable for fitting reliability growth models.

Looking at the J3.DAT data, we can identify three distinct phases:

- **Intervals 1-6 (Early phase):** The failure rate is highly variable and rising, peaking at 28-29 failures per week. This initial period reflects the early integration testing phase where many defects are being discovered. The high variability makes this region less stable for model fitting.
- **Intervals 7-23 (Middle phase):** The failure rate fluctuates but shows a general downward trend from the peak. This transitional region contains useful data showing the beginning of reliability growth.
- **Intervals 24-41 (Late phase):** The failure rate drops significantly and stabilizes at low values (0-2 failures per week), with a brief spike at interval 35 (9 failures). This region most clearly demonstrates reliability growth.

For our analysis, we used the **full dataset (intervals 1-41)** because both selected models (TL and IFRGSB) were able to capture the overall S-shaped cumulative failure curve effectively. The C-SFRAT subset slider was kept at 41 (maximum). Using the full range allows the models to capture both the initial high-failure period and the later stabilization, providing a complete picture of the system's reliability growth trajectory.

## Plots for Failure Rate and Reliability

### Cumulative Failures (MVF) Plot - No Predictions

The following plot shows the Mean Value Function (cumulative failures over time) for both top models overlaid on the imported data with no future predictions:

![MVF Plot - Top Two Models, No Predictions](Screenshots/4_MVF_Plot_Top2_Models_No_Predictions.png)

Both the IFRGSB (yellow) and TL (grey) model curves closely follow the actual cumulative failure data (black staircase). The S-shaped curve indicates classic reliability growth behavior - rapid failure accumulation early on, followed by a gradual flattening as defects are resolved and fewer new failures occur.

### Cumulative Failures (MVF) Plot - 10 Predicted Intervals

![MVF Plot - Top Two Models, 10 Predicted Intervals](Screenshots/5_MVF_Plot_Top2_Models_10_Predicted_Intervals.png)

With 10 additional predicted intervals (weeks 42-51), both models predict that cumulative failures will plateau around 355-360 total failures. The curves flatten significantly beyond interval 41, suggesting the system is approaching a stable state where very few new failures are expected.

### Cumulative Failures (MVF) Plot - 20 Predicted Intervals

![MVF Plot - Top Two Models, 20 Predicted Intervals](Screenshots/6_MVF_Plot_Top2_Models_20_Predicted_Intervals.png)

Extending predictions to 20 additional intervals (weeks 42-61) confirms the plateau behavior. Both models converge to approximately 360 total failures, with virtually no new failures predicted beyond week 50. This suggests the system has reached (or is very close to reaching) its maximum expected number of defects.

### Failure Intensity Plot

The intensity plot shows the failure rate per interval (failures per week) rather than cumulative failures:

![Failure Intensity Plot - No Predictions](Screenshots/7_Failure_Intensity_Plot_No_Predictions.png)

The bar chart represents the actual failure counts per interval, while the model curves show the fitted intensity functions. Both models capture the overall trend: the failure intensity rises to a peak around intervals 8-15 (approximately 13-15 failures per week according to the models), then steadily decreases toward 0. The actual data is more variable than the smooth model curves, which is expected since the models represent the underlying trend rather than individual fluctuations.

### Failure Intensity Plot with Predictions and Target

![Failure Intensity Plot - 10 Predictions, Target 2.0](Screenshots/8_Failure_Intensity_Plot_10_Predictions_Target2.png)

With 10 predicted intervals and a failure intensity target of 2.0 failures per week, we can observe that both model curves drop below the target rate around intervals 30-33. The predicted intensity continues to decrease in the forecast period, reaching well below 1 failure per week by interval 50.

## Decision Making Given a Target Failure Rate

Setting a target failure rate is critical for deciding when testing can be considered sufficient. Based on our analysis:

- If the target failure rate is **2 failures per week**, the system achieves this target around interval 30-33 according to both models. This means by approximately week 30 of testing, the system's failure rate has dropped below the acceptable threshold.
- If a more aggressive target of **1 failure per week** is desired, the system reaches this around interval 36-38, very close to the end of the observed testing period.
- Both models predict the intensity will continue dropping well below 1 failure per week in the predicted intervals (41-51), reinforcing confidence that the system is becoming increasingly reliable.

The implication is that if the organization's acceptable failure rate is 2 failures per week, then testing could have been considered adequate around week 30-33. However, continued testing through week 41 has brought the failure rate down further, providing additional confidence in the system's reliability.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Reliability Growth Analysis

**Advantages:**
- Provides quantitative, model-based predictions of future failure behavior, allowing teams to estimate when a target reliability level will be achieved.
- Multiple models can be compared using statistical criteria (AIC, BIC, log-likelihood) to find the best fit for a given dataset, reducing subjective bias.
- Enables "what-if" analysis by predicting how many additional testing intervals are needed to reach a desired failure rate.
- Captures the overall trend in failure data, smoothing out noise and random variation to reveal the underlying reliability improvement.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires sufficient failure data to produce meaningful results - too few data points can lead to poor model fits or unreliable predictions.
- The choice of model can significantly affect predictions, and there is no guarantee that any model perfectly represents the true failure process.
- Effort variables (E, F, C) are often unavailable in practice and must be assumed, which introduces uncertainty into the analysis.
- Models assume that the testing process and environment remain relatively consistent over time, which may not always hold true in real projects.
- The analysis is retrospective - it works best for assessing past testing data and may not account for sudden changes in the software (e.g., major refactors or new feature additions).

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart

## Overview

For Part 2, we used the RDC-11 Excel tool to assess whether the SUT meets a target MTTF. The RDC provides a visual method for reliability acceptance testing by plotting observed failure data against three decision regions: Accept (green), Continue Testing (yellow), and Reject (red).

We used the DATA2.DAT dataset (28 failures, cumulative CPU time in seconds) and entered the failure number and cumulative failure times into the RDC-11 Failure Data sheet. The risk parameters were kept at the default values: Discrimination Ratio (gamma) = 2.0, Developer's Risk (alpha) = 0.100, and User's Risk (beta) = 0.100.

## Determining MTTF_min

To find the minimum MTTF (MTTF_min) for which the SUT becomes acceptable, we experimented with various MTTF values by adjusting the "Per Number of input events" field (E3) in the Failure Data sheet of the RDC-11 tool. The FIO (Failure Intensity Objective) was set to 1 failure per the specified number of input events, making the MTTF equal to the value in E3. All 28 failures from DATA2.DAT were entered into the tool.

We tested the following MTTF values and observed the corresponding behavior on the RDC:

| MTTF (seconds) | RDC Result |
|----------------|------------|
| 3000 | Reject - points deep in red zone |
| 2000 | Reject/Continue - points at red/yellow border |
| 1600 | Continue - points in yellow zone |
| 1200 | Continue - points in yellow zone |
| 1000 | Continue - points approaching yellow/green border |
| 800 | Borderline Accept - points just entering green zone |
| 600 | Accept - points clearly in green zone |
| 400 | Accept - points deeply in green zone |

Based on this analysis, we determined **MTTF_min = 800 seconds**. At this value, the observed failure data just barely crosses into the Accept region of the RDC, meaning the SUT meets the minimum reliability requirement at this MTTF target.

## RDC Plots

### Plot 1: MTTF_min = 800 seconds

![RDC at MTTF_min = 800](Screenshots/9_RDC_MTTFmin_1250.png)

At MTTF_min = 800 seconds, the failure data points begin in the reject/continue region for the first few failures, then the trend curves rightward and just enters the accept (green) zone around failure 7. This indicates that the SUT barely meets the reliability target at this MTTF. The increasing time between later failures causes the data to bend toward the accept region, confirming reliability growth in the dataset.

### Plot 2: 2x MTTF_min = 1600 seconds

![RDC at 2x MTTF_min = 1600](Screenshots/10_RDC_Double_MTTFmin_2500.png)

At double the MTTF_min (1600 seconds), the data points remain entirely within the yellow (Continue Test) zone. This means the SUT does not meet the more stringent reliability requirement at this target. The normalized failure times are compressed (smaller x-values due to the larger MTTF denominator), keeping the data points closer to the y-axis and within the continue/reject regions. More testing would be needed to reach a verdict at this MTTF.

### Plot 3: 0.5x MTTF_min = 400 seconds

![RDC at 0.5x MTTF_min = 400](Screenshots/11_RDC_Half_MTTFmin_625.png)

At half the MTTF_min (400 seconds), the data points move clearly into the green (Accept) zone by around failure 6-7. The failure data trend curves strongly to the right due to the larger normalized x-values, spreading the data points across the chart and pushing them well into the accept region. This confirms that the system comfortably exceeds this lower reliability target.

## Summary of RDC Results

The three plots demonstrate the expected behavior of the RDC: as the MTTF target increases (stricter reliability requirement), it becomes harder for the system to be accepted. Conversely, a lower MTTF target makes acceptance easier. The MTTF_min of 800 seconds represents the threshold where the system transitions from "continue testing" to "acceptable."

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Reliability Demonstration Chart

**Advantages:**
- Provides a simple, visual method for making accept/reject/continue decisions about system reliability, making it accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- Requires only failure time data and a target MTTF - no complex model fitting or parameter estimation is needed.
- Allows quick "what-if" analysis by adjusting the MTTF target and immediately seeing the impact on the accept/reject decision.
- Works well with limited failure data (even a small number of failures can be plotted and assessed).
- The three-region chart (accept, continue, reject) provides clear actionable outcomes for project managers.

**Disadvantages:**
- Does not provide quantitative predictions of future failure behavior or reliability growth trends - it only gives a pass/fail/continue verdict.
- The chart's fixed display range can make it difficult to visualize all data points when there are many failures or when the normalized values extend beyond the chart boundaries.
- Sensitive to the choice of risk parameters (discrimination ratio, developer's risk, user's risk) - different settings can lead to different conclusions.
- Does not account for the underlying failure process or testing conditions - it treats all failures equally regardless of severity or context.
- Finding the MTTF_min requires manual trial-and-error experimentation with different MTTF values.

# Comparison of Results

Both techniques were applied to failure data from hypothetical systems and provided complementary insights into reliability assessment.

**Part 1 (Reliability Growth Testing with C-SFRAT)** showed that the system represented by J3.DAT exhibits clear reliability growth. The failure intensity starts high (peaking around 15 failures per week) and decreases to near-zero by week 41. Both top models (TL and IFRGSB) predict the system will plateau at approximately 360 total failures, with the failure rate dropping below 2 failures per week by interval 30-33.

**Part 2 (RDC with DATA2.DAT)** showed that the system represented by DATA2 meets a minimum MTTF target of 800 seconds. Below this threshold, the system is accepted; above it, more testing is needed. The RDC analysis confirmed that the time between failures increases over the course of testing (the data curves rightward), which is consistent with reliability growth.

Both analyses agree on the fundamental finding: the systems under test show improving reliability over time. The failure rate decreases and the time between failures increases as testing progresses. However, each technique provides a different type of insight - growth testing gives predictions and trend analysis, while RDC gives acceptance decisions.

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

**Similarities:**
- Both techniques analyze failure data collected during testing to assess system reliability.
- Both can indicate whether reliability is improving over time.
- Both require failure data as input and produce visual outputs (plots/charts) to support decision-making.
- Both are used in the context of integration or system-level testing rather than unit testing.

**Differences:**
- Reliability Growth Testing fits mathematical models to the data and provides quantitative predictions (future failure rates, expected total failures), while RDC provides a qualitative accept/reject/continue decision.
- Growth testing requires choosing among multiple models and evaluating goodness-of-fit, adding complexity. RDC requires only setting a target MTTF and risk parameters.
- Growth testing uses failure count data (failures per interval), while RDC uses time-between-failures or cumulative failure time data.
- Growth testing is better suited for ongoing monitoring and planning (e.g., "how many more weeks of testing do we need?"), while RDC is better for milestone-based acceptance decisions (e.g., "does the system meet our MTTF requirement?").
- Growth testing can handle large datasets with many intervals effectively, while RDC works best with smaller datasets due to chart display constraints.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Reliability growth testing is more informative but requires more effort in model selection and interpretation. RDC is simpler to use but provides less detailed insight.
- Using both techniques together gives a more complete picture - growth testing for understanding trends and making predictions, and RDC for making concrete accept/reject decisions against a target.
- The choice of dataset and data format matters - failure count data works for growth testing, while cumulative failure times are needed for RDC.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The team divided the work as follows:

- **Muhammad Zain:** Led the C-SFRAT analysis (Part 1), including data preparation, model selection, and generating all plots. Also coordinated the RDC analysis and report compilation.
- **Yazin Abdul Majid:** Contributed to the RDC analysis (Part 2), experimented with MTTF values, and helped with the comparison and discussion sections of the report.
- **Fateh Ali Syed Bukhari:** Assisted with data preparation, reviewed the report for accuracy, and contributed to the advantages/disadvantages and lessons learned sections.

All team members reviewed the final report and contributed to the discussion sections.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

- **C-SFRAT data format:** The raw .DAT files required conversion to CSV format with specific column headers (T, FC, E, F, C). Since effort data was not provided, we had to make reasonable assumptions (setting E, F, C to 1), which we documented clearly in the report.
- **Model convergence issues:** One model (IFR SB with no covariates) failed to converge properly, producing an extremely large AIC. We identified this from the comparison table and excluded it from our top model selection.
- **RDC chart display limits:** The RDC-11 chart has a fixed display range (y-axis up to ~16, x-axis up to ~16), which meant that with many failures or extreme normalized values, not all data points were visible. We worked around this by carefully adjusting the MTTF to find the appropriate range.
- **Finding MTTF_min:** Determining the minimum acceptable MTTF required iterative trial-and-error, testing multiple values and observing the chart behavior. This process was time-consuming but ultimately straightforward.
- **Key lesson:** Combining both reliability assessment techniques provides a more robust evaluation than using either one alone. Growth testing reveals trends and predictions, while RDC provides clear decision criteria.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab provided a practical introduction to reliability assessment tools and techniques. The hands-on experience with C-SFRAT and RDC-11 helped us understand how failure data can be analyzed to make informed decisions about software quality. The assignment instructions were clear, particularly the step-by-step example for data conversion to C-SFRAT format. One area for improvement would be providing more guidance on interpreting RDC results when the data extends beyond the chart's display range, as this was a source of initial confusion. Overall, the lab effectively demonstrated the value of reliability assessment in the software testing lifecycle.
